# EXPERIMENT -- Open Source Web-based hybrid home screen
maybe with Emscripten-compiled Web-Assembly code  
and **developed by using a directly Native Script** (_NativeScript_) **to plug-in web technology** (_JavaScript_)  
**to the device platform application interface without a bridge between the native platform code to Web-View rendering**.

## Description

Open experiment to make a Web-based alternative launcher (home screen) to use with other multi-tasking app launchers  
([Smart Dock](https://github.com/axel358/smartdock) & [Taskbar](https://github.com/farmerbb/Taskbar)), that  
will NOT have features to open or use native apps but rather will be able to show some choice of direct access  
to Web content through its Web App and Native-Script API interface. _Auto-push-mirrored to a GitHub (public) repository._
