# EXPERIMENT -- Open Source Web-based hybrid home screen
**with an AAC (Web) application container feature to display communication help websites from the lock screen when locked**  
**by a way of a simple WebView-based wrapper app activity which shows a single website on top of the lock screen when launched from it.**

Hybrid home screen function: maybe with Emscripten-compiled Web-Assembly code - and  
**developed by using a native script directly** (_NativeScript_) **to plug-in web technology** (_JavaScript_) to the device platform  
application interface _without a bridge between the native platform code to Web-View rendering_ (_hybrid app_ "abstraction frameworks").

## Description

Open experiment to make a Web-based alternative launcher (home screen) to use with other multi-tasking app launchers  
([Smart Dock](https://github.com/axel358/smartdock) & [Taskbar](https://github.com/farmerbb/Taskbar)), that  
will NOT have features to open or use native apps but rather will be able to show some choice of direct access  
to Web content through its Web App and Native-Script API interface. _Auto-push-mirrored to a GitHub (public) repository._
